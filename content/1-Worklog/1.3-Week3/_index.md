### Week 3 Objectives:

- Master AWS Networking Fundamentals: Gain in-depth knowledge of VPC architecture, Subnets, Route Tables, Internet/NAT Gateways, and network security mechanisms (Security Groups, NACLs, VPC Flow Logs).

- Deploy Secure Network Infrastructure: Configure secure connectivity using EC2 Instance Connect Endpoints, establish Site-to-Site VPN connections, and set up VPC Peering.

- Integrate Hybrid DNS & Identity Services: Set up Hybrid DNS using Route 53 Resolver, deploy Microsoft Active Directory on AWS, and establish access via RDGW.

- Implement Monitoring & Automation: Deploy CloudWatch Monitoring, initialize infrastructure using CloudFormation templates, and refine security group configurations.
