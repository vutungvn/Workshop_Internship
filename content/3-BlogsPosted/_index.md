During the 15-week internship I published **3 in-depth technical blogs** on [AWS Study Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/awsstudygroupfcj) — analyzing real-world case studies on AWS, covering new service features, cost optimization with IaC, and using AI services to solve concrete enterprise problems.

### [3.1. Blog 1](3.1-Blog1/)

Running non-production environments (Dev, Test, Staging) 24/7 generates massive idle cloud spend for enterprises. This blog introduces an automated FinOps pattern combining **AWS Lambda**, **Amazon EventBridge**, and **Resource Tagging** to dynamically shut down idle EC2 instances and RDS databases outside working hours. By scheduling automated start/stop actions and validating instance tags, this solution helps DevOps teams reduce non-production compute costs by up to **60-70%** without impacting developer workflows.

### [3.2. Blog 2](3.2-Blog2/)

Millions of paper medical records in hospitals are still being keyed in manually at a cost of **millions of USD/year** and an error rate of 5-15%. This blog analyzes a **serverless + event-driven** architecture combining **Amazon Bedrock Data Automation** (extracts 50+ clinical fields with AI, no training data needed) and **AWS HealthLake** (a HIPAA-eligible FHIR R4 data store) to convert scanned PDFs into standardized medical data in **~30 minutes per 1,000 records** instead of 2-3 weeks, at a cost of **<$0.50 per record** with an error rate of **<1%**.

### [3.3. Blog 3](3.3-Blog3/)

AArete built **Doczy.ai™** — a contract-intelligence system running on AWS that processed **2.5 million contracts (~50 million pages)** in 22 months, reaching **99% accuracy** (vs. 55% for older rules-based systems), making **137 million Bedrock API calls** and saving customers **~$330M**. This blog walks through the **Textract + Bedrock + Smart Chunking** architecture (AArete's core patent) and **dual clustering** (semantic + structural) — a powerful pattern for legal documents that any team building a RAG system can learn from.
